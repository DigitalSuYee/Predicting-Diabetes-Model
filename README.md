# Predicting-Diabetes-Model
Diabetes is a prevalent health concern affecting individuals worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk is crucial for implementing preventive measures and promoting better health outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes risk assessment using a dataset containing relevant health parameters.

# Problem Statement
Many people around the world have diabetes, and we need a way to find out who might get it early on. Right now, there aren't easy tools for regular people or doctors to check someone's risk of getting diabetes using important health information. So, we want to make a simple and reliable computer program to do just that â€“ help people and doctors know the risk of diabetes early, so they can take action and plan personalized ways to stay healthy.
